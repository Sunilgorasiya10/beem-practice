For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific accounts on Beem, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Services, in person or online through any means and functionalities available to them, regardless of whether such means and functionalities are supported or made available by Beem. Additionally, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction will be visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change their audience later at will.\n\nPeople can also use our Services to create and share content about you with the audience they choose. For example, people can share a photo of you in a post, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages. If you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Services, you can report the content. Beem will then communicate with you through its Services to consider the appropriate action to be taken following the report. While it is likely we will remove the content you report from our Services, removal of reported content is not guaranteed. Beem handles reported content on a case-by-case basis.",

Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.\n\nWhen you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Services, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you book an Uber ride from your Beem app, Uber can receive information about your activities in the Beem app. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Beem, and any information that you share with them.

Learn more in your Beem account settings.\n\nWe store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our Services, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after submission.\n\nWhen you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later.

This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.\n\nWhen we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of our Services, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Services), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Services.\n\nInformation we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Beem) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.
